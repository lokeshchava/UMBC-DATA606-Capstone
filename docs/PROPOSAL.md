# 2. Background
Insurance Fraud bumps up to millions of dollars every year for insurance companies. it is very essential to have a fraud detection system in place to avoid fraudulent claims and maintain fairness in the claim process, thus enhancing the company's reputation and building trust.
- **What is it about?**  
  A fraud detection system for Vehicle insurance claims helps in identifying fraudulent requests for insurance claims and helps in improving a very robust and autonomous system.  
- **Why does it matter?**  
  Fraudulent claims introduce additional risk to insurance portfolios. By detecting and preventing fraud, insurance companies can better manage their risk exposure and maintain the financial health of the organization.  
- **What are your research questions?**  
  How to classify the fair and fraud requests?   
  what are the factors that determine fraud activities?  
  which algorithm best suits the model?  
# 3. Data 

Describe the datasets you are using to answer your research questions.

- Data sources: [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khusheekapoor/vehicle-insurance-fraud-detection)
- Data size: 3.69 MB
- Data shape: 15420 rows, 33 columns
- Data dictionary
   - Integer type columns: WeekOfMonth, WeekOfMonthClaimed, Age, PolicyNumber, RepNumber, Deductible, DriverRating, Year
   - Object type Columns: Month, DayOfWeek, Make, AccidentArea, DayOfWeekClaimed, MonthClaimed, Sex, MaritalStatus, Fault, PolicyType, VehicleCategory, VehiclePrice,
       Days:Policy-Accident, Days:Policy-Claim, PastNumberOfClaims, AgeOfVehicle, AgeOfPolicyHolder, PoliceReportFiled, WitnessPresent, AgentType,
       NumberOfSuppliments, AddressChange-Claim, NumberOfCars, BasePolicy, FraudFound
- variable used as target/label in ML model
  - Claim Level Fraud Detection:
    - Target Variable: FraudFound. These will indicate whether a claim is fraudulent or not.  
  
- Columns selected as features/predictors for your ML models
  - Claim Level Fraud Detection:
    - Features can include various attributes related to the claim, customer, and incident:
      - Customer demographics (AGE, MARITAL_STATUS, SOCIAL_CLASS, etc.).
      - Claim details (CLAIM_AMOUNT, INCIDENT_SEVERITY, INCIDENT_STATE, etc.).
      - Incident details (DayOfWeek, PoliceReportFiled, NumberOfCars, etc.).
